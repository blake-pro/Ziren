# Program

The setting of zkMIPS is that Prover runs a public program on private inputs
and wants to convince Verifier that the program has executed correctly and produces an
asserted output, without revealing anything about the computationâ€™s input or intermediate
state.

We consider all the inputs as private, the program and output should be public.

The program can be separated into 2 parts from a developer's perspective, the program to be proved and the program to prove. 
The former program we call it [`guest`](/dev/guest-program.md), and the latter is [`host`](/dev/host-program.md).
