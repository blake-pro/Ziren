# STARK Protocol

## Polynomial Constraint System Architecture

Following [arithmetization]((./arithmetization.md)), the computation is represented through a structured polynomial system.

### Core Components
- ​Execution Trace Polynomials
  
  Encode state transitions across computation steps as:
  \\[ T_i(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} t_{i,k} \cdot L_k(x),\\]
  where \\(L_k(x)\\) are Lagrange basis polynomials over domain H. 
​
- Constraint Polynomials
  Encode verification conditions as algebraic relations:
  \\[C_j(x) = R_j(T_1(x),T_2(x), \cdots, T_m(x), T_1(g \cdot x), T_2(g \cdot x), \cdots, T_m(g \cdot x)) = 0,\\]
  for all \\(x \in H\\), where \\(g\\) is the generator of H.

### Constraint Aggregation
For proof efficiency, we combine constraints using:
\\[C_{comb}(x) = \sum_j \alpha_j C_j(x),\\]
where \\( \alpha_j\\) are derived through the Fiat-Shamir transformation.

## Mixed Matrix Commitment Scheme (MMCS)

### Polynomial Commitments in STARK

STARK uses Merkle trees for polynomial commitments:

- Setup: No trusted setup is needed, but a hash function for Merkle tree construction must be predefined. We use Poseidon2 as the predefined hash function.

- Commit: Evaluate polynomials at all roots of unity in its domain, construct a Merkle tree with these values as leaves, and publish the root as the commitment.

- Open: The verifier selects a random challenge point, and the prover provides the value and Merkle path for verification.

### Batch Commitment Protocol

The "Mixed Matrix Commitment Scheme" (MMCS) is a generalization of a vector commitment scheme used in zkMIPS. It supports:

- Committing to matrices.
- Opening rows.
- Batch operations - committing to multiple matrices simultaneously, even when they differ in dimensions.

When opening a particular row index:

- For matrices with maximum height: use the full row index.
- For smaller matrices: truncate least-significant bits of the index.

These semantics are particularly useful in the FRI protocol.

### Low-Degree Extension (LDE)

Suppose the trace polynomials are initially of length \\(N\\). For security, we evaluate them on a larger domain (e.g., \\(2^k \cdot N\\)), called the LDE domain.

Using Lagrange interpolation:
- Compute polynomial coefficients.
- Extend evaluations to the larger domain,

zkMIPS implements this via Radix2DitParallel - a parallel FFT algorithm that divides butterfly network layers into two halves.

## Low-Degree Enforcement

### Quotient Polynomial Construction

To prove \\(C_{comb}(x)\\) vanishes over subset \\(H\\), construct quotient polynomial \\(Q(x)\\):
\\[Q(x) = \frac{C_{comb}(x)} {Z_{H}(x)} = \frac{\sum_j \alpha_j C_j(x)}{\prod_{h \in H}(x-h)}.\\]

The existence of such a low-degree \\(Q(x)\\) proves \\(C_{comb}(x)\\) vanishes over \\(H\\).

## FRI Protocol 

The Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof (FRI) protocol proves the low-degree of \\(P(x)\\). zkMIPS optimizes FRI by leveraging:
- Algebraic structure of quartic extension \\(\mathbb{F}_{p^4}\\).
- KoalaBear prime field \\(p = 2^{31} - 2^{24} + 1\\).
- Efficient Poseidon2 hash computation.

**Three-Phase FRI Procedure**
- Commitment Phase:

  - The prover splits \\(P(x)\\) into two lower-degree polynomials \\(P_0(x)\\), \\(P_1(x)\\), such that: \\(P(x) = P_0(x^2) + x \cdot P_1(x^2)\\).

  - The verifier sends a random challenge \\(\alpha \in  \mathbb{F}_{p^4}\\) 
  - The prover computes a new polynomial: \\(P'(x) = P_0(x) + \alpha \cdot P_1(x)\\), and sends the commitment of the polynomials to the verifier.

- ​Recursive Reduction:
  - Repeat splitting process for \\(P'(x)\\).
  - Halve degree each iteration until constant term or degree ≤ d.

- ​Verification Phase:
  - Verifier checks consistency between committed values at random point \\(z\\) in initial subgroup.

## Verifing 

### Verification contents

Through merkle opening technique, verifier checks the following relation at a randomly chosen point at the LDE domain:

- Confirm correct folding via Merkle proofs.

- Ensure the final polynomial is a constant (or has degree no more than d).

- Proper computation of
  - Constraint polynomials  \\(C_j(x)\\).
  -  Combined constraint \\(c_{comb}(x)\\).

### Grinding Factor & Repeating Factor

Given the probabilistic nature of STARK verification, the protocol prevents brute-force attacks by requiring either:
- A Proof of Work (PoW) accompanying each proof, or
- multiple verification rounds.

This approach significantly increases the computational cost of malicious attempts. In zkMIPS, we employ multiple verification rounds to achieve the desired security level.
