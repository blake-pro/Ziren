# Installation

zkMIPS is now available for Linux and macOS systems.

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Rust (Nightly)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Option 1: Quick Install

To install the zkMIPS toolchain, use the `zkmup` installer. Simply open your terminal, run the command below, and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zkMIPS/toolchain/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | sh
```

It will:
- Download the `zkmup` installer.
- Automatically utilize `zkmup` to install the latest zkMIPS Rust toolchain which has support for the `mipsel-zkm-zkvm-elf` compilation target.

List all available toolchain versions:

```bash
$ zkmup list-available
20250224 20250108 20241217
```

Now you can run zkMIPS examples or unit tests.

```
git clone https://github.com/zkMIPS/zkMIPS
cd zkMIPS && cargo test -r
```

### Troubleshooting

The following error may occur:

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by cargo)
cargo: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.33' not found (required by cargo)
cargo: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by cargo)
```

Currently, our prebuilt binaries are built for Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS. Systems running older GLIBC versions may experience compatibility issues and will need to build the toolchain from source.

## Option 2: Building from Source

For more details, please refer to document [toolchain](https://github.com/zkMIPS/toolchain.git).
